# Error Log

## 2025-10-10

**Error:** Both simple and hybrid analyses were failing with the message "Analysis failed. Please try again."

**Root Cause:** The application was unable to connect to the Reddit API due to an issue with how the API credentials were being loaded. The `praw.Reddit` client was being initialized at the module level in `api/analysis_engine.py`, which caused problems with loading the environment variables from the `.env` file, especially in the context of the Celery worker.

**Fix:**

1.  **Refactored Reddit Client Initialization:** The global `praw.Reddit` instance was removed from `api/analysis_engine.py`.
2.  **Created `get_reddit_client()` Function:** A new function, `get_reddit_client()`, was created in `api/analysis_engine.py`. This function creates and returns an authenticated Reddit client on demand, getting the credentials from the `Config` object in `api/config.py`.
3.  **Updated `get_reddit_sentiment()`:** The `get_reddit_sentiment()` function was updated to use the new `get_reddit_client()` function.
4.  **Removed Redundant Code:** The unnecessary `load_dotenv()` call in `api/tasks.py` was removed.

This ensures that the Reddit API client is always initialized with the correct credentials, both in the main Flask application and in the Celery worker.
