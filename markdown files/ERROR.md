# Error Log

## 2025-10-10

**Error:** Both simple and hybrid analyses were failing with the message "Analysis failed. Please try again."

**Root Cause:** The application was unable to connect to the Reddit API due to an issue with how the API credentials were being loaded.

**Fix:** Refactored the Reddit client initialization to be on-demand within the analysis functions, ensuring it uses the correct credentials from the application config.

**Issue:** The hybrid analysis appears to hang or get stuck, with no terminal output for over 5 minutes.

**Analysis:** This was identified as a performance and feedback issue. The long-running analysis tasks (model download, LSTM training) gave no feedback, making the app appear frozen.

**Next Steps / Recommendations:** Improve user feedback by adding more granular progress updates from the backend and displaying them on the frontend.

**Issue:** The application would hang indefinitely if an analysis was started while the Celery worker was not running. The user had no way to know if the backend was processing the request or if it was stuck.

**Root Cause:** The frontend polling mechanism had no timeout. It would continue to poll the status of a "PENDING" task forever.

**Fix:** Implemented a timeout mechanism in the `pollTaskStatus` function in `frontend/src/App.js`.

1.  A timer is started when polling begins.
2.  The timeout is set to 3 minutes for simple analysis and 5 minutes for hybrid analysis.
3.  If the task does not complete within this time, the polling stops, and a specific error message is displayed to the user: "Analysis timed out. Please ensure backend services are running and try again."
4.  This provides clear feedback to the user when the Celery worker is down and prevents the application from appearing to be stuck.
