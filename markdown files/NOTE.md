# Project Assessment: Pre-Stocked

This project is a well-structured web application for stock analysis that combines time-series forecasting with sentiment analysis.

## Strengths:

*   **Clear Architecture:** The project is well-organized into a Flask backend and a React frontend.
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:** It uses Celery and Redis to run analysis in the background, which keeps the UI responsive.
*   **Component-Based Frontend:** The frontend is broken down into reusable components, which improves maintainability.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The backend uses custom exceptions to provide specific error messages to the frontend.
*   **Hybrid Analysis:** The application uses a sophisticated approach by combining multiple models (ARIMA, LSTM, FinBERT) for its analysis.
*   **Good Documentation:** The project includes good technical and user-facing documentation.

## Weaknesses:

*   **Lack of Tests:** There is no automated test suite for the application's logic.
*   **UI/UX could be polished:** While functional, the user interface could be improved with a more professional design and user experience.

## Program Flow:

1.  **User Interaction (Frontend):**
    *   The user interacts with the `AnalysisForm` component to enter a stock ticker and choose an analysis type.
    *   On submission, a `POST` request is sent to the `/analyze` endpoint.

2.  **Backend Request Handling (Flask):
    *   The `/analyze` route starts a Celery background task (`run_full_analysis` or `run_hybrid_analysis_task`).
    *   It returns a `task_id` to the frontend.

3.  **Frontend Polling:**
    *   The frontend polls the `/status/<task_id>` endpoint every 5 seconds.

4.  **Asynchronous Analysis (Celery):
    *   The Celery worker executes the task.
    *   **Error Handling:** If an error occurs (e.g., invalid ticker, Reddit API failure), the task raises a custom exception (`StockDataError`, `RedditAPIError`, etc.). The task's state is set to `FAILURE`, and the error message is stored.
    *   If successful, the results are stored in the PostgreSQL database.

5.  **Backend Task Status:**
    *   The `/status/<task_id>` route returns the task's state.
    *   If the state is `FAILURE`, it returns the specific error message.

6.  **Frontend Display:**
    *   If the frontend receives a `FAILURE` state, it displays the specific error message to the user using the `ErrorMessage` component.
    *   If the task is `SUCCESS`ful, the frontend fetches the data from `/data/<ticker>` or `/hybrid_data/<ticker>` and displays it using the `ResultsDisplay` component.
